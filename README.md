# TFitness Personal Training

## Brief Overview

This is my website based on Tony Albutt, a personal friend of mine who specialises in personal training.
The website is designed to promote his fitness brand and gain more clients.
The website includes information about his background in personal training and ways that he would be of benefit to new clients.
I have ensured that the site works effieciently for user experience, with clear titles describing the different fitness plans that Tony
offers.

The website is designed to attract a range of age groups however, it's main purpose is to target young adults.
The design is a sophisticated colour scheme that is pleasing to the eye, something that is important for this particular age group.
The website is meant to persuade visitors into signing up to T-fit, so they can begin their fitness journey. I have included plenty of
information about each plan which gives the users an insight to what they are signing up to.
I think the site is effective in delivering a range of information about Tony, and the knowledge he obtains.
Overall, it's sole purpose is to provide information about T-Fit.

## Design Process

Before making my website I started drawing out mockups of what i invisioned -
These were very rough but it helped to get a vague idea.
Once I had chosen a layout I picked a colour scheme which I have consistently used throughout the site; Navy blue, grey and gold.
The design I chose was for aesthetic purposes and to suit the age group I am targeting.
I have kept it minimal and modern to make the user experience easier.

## Features

Carousel - This feature adds style and relevance to the home page. Which tells the user what the website is about. I have also used it for aesthetic purposes. I used bootstrap framework to design this.

Drop down nav-bar - This helps with keeping the site tidy and clean on smaller devices for easy navigation and better user experience. I used bootstrap frame work to design this.

Call to action buttons - Ways for the user to get around the site without having to scroll top to bottom. This also helps the user get the relevant information they need. I used an old coursework code to aid my design.

Contact text form - A clear and neat layout of input fields for the user to get in contact with Tony. An easy way for them to enquire about booking a session. I used one of my old code institute coursework project codes to design this.

Links to socials - An easy and modern way for clients to get in touch via other platforms. I used an old coursework code to design this.

#### Features left to implement

Merchandise page - I would have had a page of Tony's merchandise however, I don't yet have the skills in javascript to make online purchases possible.

Video footage - I would have included fitness videos within the programmes page.

All pages - I would have liked to improve upon the way the website text is displayed on smaller devices.

### Device testing

During my project, I consistently checked the websited compatibility with all device sizes to ensure the best user experience possible.
I ensured this by using Chromes built in developer tools.
This website works well on all device sizes although I did encounter some issues on mobile device size with the text overflow.

I had a number of work collegues/ friends trial the website out for feedback so that i could make improvments from early development stages
 regarding a users experience.
